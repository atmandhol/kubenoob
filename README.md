# kubenoob

kubenoob is set of scratch notes that I make when I learn something related to Kubernetes or any other CNCF projects in general. It is just some markdown based notes for now. I will deploy this somewhere when I have some content in.

## Local Run

This docs are using an amazing open source tool called [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), and an even more amazing theme for it called [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). 

### To run locally

- Create a python3 virtualenv and then install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the local MkDocs server

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
