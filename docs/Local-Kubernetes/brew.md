# Useful Brew Installs

I am using `brew` to install most tools and packages if they are available on it.
Here is a list of all packages I have installed on my local to make working with kubernetes really fun and productive.

```
brew install fzf gcc kind kubectx minikube tanzu-community-edition
```
